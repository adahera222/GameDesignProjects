Games made with Unity3D

Right now this repository only contains the final project game made for my CS401 Game Design course.
It is written with Unity3D and UnityScript. All assets are homebrewed. 

The game is a top-down 2D puzzle game where one plays as a cube of jelly attempting to push
peanut butter cubes through various obstacles onto pieces of bread to make a PB&J sandwich.
