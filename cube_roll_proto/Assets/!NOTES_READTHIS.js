/*
this is for us to edit to put notes in for each other

PIVOTS:
Whenever you make an object that uses the pivot code, you need to create an empty game object to as a pivot for the object.
	After you make it, assign it to that object's pivot point field within the script in the inspector panel
	
TAGS:
	make sure you tag objects that move with the jelly as "Jelly"
	
MOVEMENT SPEED:
	do not tweak the movement speed of any of the rotating objects, or else they will be able to clip through one another
	
LEVELS:
	use the GeneralLevelManager script to make a level reload. hit r to do so. also, make a new tag for each level and set the tag of the 
	object the generallevelmanager script is attached to to the name of the tag for the scene
